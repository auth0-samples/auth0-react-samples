# Auth0 React Samples

These samples demonstrate how to add authentication to a React application with Auth0. Each folder contains a distinct application so that various Auth0 features can be viewed in isolation.

## Embedded Integration Samples

These samples use Auth0's [hosted login page](https://auth0.com/docs/hosted-pages/login) which offers the fastest, most secure, and most feature-rich way to add authentication to your app.

For samples which demonstrate how to embed the Lock widget or a custom login form directly into your application, see the [embedded-login](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-react-samples/tree/embedded-login) branch.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
